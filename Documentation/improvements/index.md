# Improvements
1. refactoring all the code using some javascript design pattern and latest feature of the language (ecmascript6).
2. consider to move from sails to [loopBack]("https://loopback.io/").
3. consider to change ngAdmin to something custom structured like blurAdmin.
4. handle migrations.
5. apply more conventions to the code ( apis, model and tables name )
6. rewrite the config object use to build the gui in a more maintainable and modular way.
